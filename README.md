# 🎤 Objection

Slam your hand on the table and shout “OBJECTION!” — just like Ace Attorney.

## Description

Objection is a mobile app that uses your phone’s accelerometer to detect a hand slam on a table.
When a slam is detected, the app:

- Measures the linear acceleration (in m/s²)
- Instantly plays the iconic “Objection!” voice line
- Tracks how many objections you’ve delivered
- Lets you tune sensitivity for different tables & play styles

The goal is to simulate the physical feeling of playing Ace Attorney in real life
